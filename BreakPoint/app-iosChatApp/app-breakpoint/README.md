# Chat app 

Swift 4 referesher project, building a chat app were a user can login with either a social media account or email.  Once a user is logged in they are taken to their profile page, the user profile page is a tab controller.  The tabs at the bottom of profile page are how the user navigates to their feeds, groups or profile depending on which view they are on.
